SMART on FHIR JavaScript Library
================================

This is a JavaScript library for connecting SMART apps to FHIR servers.
It works both in browsers (IE 10+) and on the server (Node 10+).


> This is the documentation for version 2+. If you want to migrate from older versions, please check out **[what's new in v2](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/v2.html)** and [migration instructions](migration). For older versions see [http://docs.smarthealthit.org/clients/javascript/](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/clients/javascript/).

## Browser Usage

In the browser you typically have to create two separate pages that correspond to your
`launch_uri` (Launch Page) and `redirect_uri` (Index Page).

### As Library

**Launch Page**
```html
<!-- launch.html -->
<script src="./node_module/fhirclient/build/fhir-client.js"></script>
<script>
FHIR.oauth2.authorize({
    "client_id": "my_web_app",
    "scope": "patient/*.read"
});
</script>
```

**Index Page**
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script src="./node_module/fhirclient/build/fhir-client.js"></script>
<script>
FHIR.oauth2.ready()
    .then(client => client.request("Patient"))
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error);
</script>
```

### As Module
**Launch Page**
```js
import FHIR from "fhirclient"
FHIR.oauth2.authorize({
    "client_id": "my_web_app",
    "scope": "patient/*.read"
});
```

**Index Page**
```js
import FHIR from "fhirclient"
FHIR.oauth2.ready()
    .then(client => client.request("Patient"))
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error);
```

## Server Usage
The server is fundamentally different environment than the browser but the
API is very similar. Here is a simple Express example:
```js
const fhirClient = require("fhirclient");

// This is what the EHR will call
app.get("/launch", (req, res) => {
    fhirClient(req, res).authorize({
        "client_id": "my_web_app",
        "scope": "patient/*.read"
    });
});

// This is what the Auth server will redirect to
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    fhirClient(req, res).ready()
        .then(client => client.request("Patient"))
        .then(res.json)
        .catch(res.json);
});
```
Read more at the [NodeJS API Details](node).

## SMART API
The SMART API is a collection of SMART-specific methods (`authorize`, `ready`, `init`) for app
authorization and launch. If you are working in a browser, the SMART API is automatically created,
and available at `window.FHIR.oauth2`. In NodeJS, the library exports a function that should be
called with a http request and response objects, and will return the same SMART API as in the browser. 

```js
// BROWSER
const smart = FHIR.oauth2;
smart.authorize(options);

// SERVER
const smart = require("fhirclient");
smart(request, response).authorize(options);
```
Read the [SMART API Documentation](api)


   

## Client
This is a FHIR client that is returned to you from the `ready()` or the `init()`
SMART API calls. You can also create it yourself if needed. For example, there
is no need to authorize against an open FHIR server. You can skip that and start
by creating a client instance:
```js
// BROWSER
const client = FHIR.client({
    serverUrl: "https://r4.smarthealthit.org"
});

// SERVER
const client = fhirClient(req, res).client({
    serverUrl: "https://r4.smarthealthit.org"
});
```

The client instance exposes a super-powered `request` method that you use to query
the FHIR server and a bunch of other useful utilities and methods.
[Read the full Client API docs](client).


## Fhir.js Integration
Since v2.0 this library no longer includes fhir.js. That architecture was
extremely difficult to maintain. Fhir.js is now an optional dependency, meaning
that it is not available by default, unless you include it in the page.
Our goal is to provide a simple alternative to fhir.js - most of it should be
possible via `client.request`. Please see the [Examples](fhirjs-equivalents).

You are now free to choose what version of fhir.js to include. For backward
compatibility try [our fork of fhir.js](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-js/blob/9e77b7b26b5d7dff7e65f25625441e0905f84811/lib/jqFhir.js).
It is not maintained any more, and it would require Jquery to be included in the page.
Newer versions of fhir.js work fine, but might have different API or return result
objects with different shape.

#### Reasons to use fhir.js
1. If you have old apps using legacy API like `client.api.anyFhirJsMethod()` or `client.patient.api.anyFhirJsMethod()`
2. If you prefer the mongodb-like query syntax.
3. If you are trying to do something specific that can only be done with fhir.js 

#### Reasons not to use fhir.js
1. If you prefer to build the fhir queries yourself using fhir syntax.
2. If you encounter fhir-version-specific issues with fhir.js
3. If you want to keep things simpler and smaller

#### Browser Integration
You just need to include fhir.js (`nativeFhir.js`) in the page via script tag.
We will detect that and make the necessary linking. You can then use it via
`client.api` and `client.patient.api`, just like it used to work with older
versions of this library. The latest build of fhir.js that we have tested with
is available at [lib/nativeFhir.js](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-js/blob/master/lib/nativeFhir.js).
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script src="/path/to/nativeFhir.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/fhir-client.js"></script>
<script>
FHIR.oauth2.ready().then(client => client.api.search({ type: "Patient" }))
</script>
```

#### NodeJS Integration
There are no global variables to detect so you'll have to link it manually using
the dedicated `connect(fhirJs)` method of the client:
```js
const fhirJs = require("fhir.js");

// Inside a route handler
app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
    const client = await smart(req, res).ready();
    client.connect(fhirJs);
    client.api.search({ type: "Patient" }).then(res.json).catch(res.json);
});
```

## Debugging
This library uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) module.

To enable debug logging in Node use the `DEBUG` env variable:
```sh
DEBUG='FHIR.*' node my-app
```
In the browser execute this in the console and then reload the page:
```js
localStorage.debug = "FHIR.*"
```
