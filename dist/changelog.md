# Changelog

## v2.5.2
- Fix base64url encoding for PKCE #158
- Simplified the code and removed IE support for new SMART V2 features like PKCE and asymmetric authentication.

## v2.5.1
- Changed the architecture to avoid build issues #156. Version `2.5.0` cannot be use for client-side builds (but works in NodeJS or if loaded as a bundle) and `v2.5.1` provides a fix for that.
- No other changes

## v2.5.0
- Added `PKCE` support
- Added support for asymmetric authentication
- Passing `onSuccess` and `onError` callbacks to `FHIR.oauth2.ready` (which was previously deprecated) is no longer supported
- IE10 is no longer supported
- Supports NodeJS versions 14 to 18
- Update all dependencies and dev tools. Zero audit issues at the time of release.
- `.well-known/smart-configuration` is now the preferred source of metadata and `/metadata` is only fetched if smart-configuration is not found on the given server.
- Fixed an issue that might prevent users from setting custom http headers (#153)
- Added GitHub actions, e2e tests in headless browser and improved coverage reports

## v2.4.0
- Added `patch` method to the client
- Added `noRedirect` authorize option 
- Some bug fixes:
  - Empty body response after create operation but no location header #118, #124
  - Epic may return a full url #105
- Small documentation and type definition changes and improvements

## v2.3.11
- `HttpError` instances (which are thrown when a request has failed) now have a `response` property that is a reference to the
  Response object. This can be used to read response headers or inspect the response in some other way in case of error.
- Client requests should now always fail with `HttpError`. Previously they were sometimes being rejected with custom `Error`
  objects which do not have the response or the status code information.
- All the request methods (except for the ones used for refreshing) can now accept new `includeResponse` boolean option. The affected methods are
  `client.request`, `client.create`, `client.update`, `client.delete`, `client.patient.read`, `client.user.read`, `client.encounter.read` and `client.patient.request`.

- In case of EHR launch the `authorize` function can now be called with an array of options. This makes it possible to pre-configure an
  app to be launch-able from multiple EHRs. The right configuration will be picked based on the passed `iss` url parameter using the new 
  `issMatch` option. [Read More](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/open_servers#2-using-multiple-launch-configurations)

## v2.3.10
- Fixed the way access token expiration is computed for non-jwt tokens (#101).
- Added a `body` property to the `HttpError` instances (#100). It will contain the parsed response body from failed requests which can be JSON (typically an `OperationOutcome` resource), a string or `null`.

## v2.3.8
- Changed the way the "auto-refresh" flow works. Before `2.3.8` the client was obtaining new access token if a request fails with `401`. Since `2.3.8`, the client will check the access token expiration time before making a request. This is done to avoid CORS-related issues with servers that do not emit CORS headers in case of error.
- The refresh token requests will now be sent without credentials. In the rare cases when the auth server requires the app to send cookies, developers will have to configure the client to do so.
- Added support for the `..` path operator in `client.getPath`, `client.getState` and the `resolveReferences` option of `client.request`. This was done to allow paths like `identifier..assigner`, which will match if identifier is an array of objects having an assigner reference property.

## v2.3.5
- The `completeInTarget` authorize option defaults to `true` if the app was loaded in an iframe
- The `redirectUri` option accepts absolute URLs and does not append "/" to them
- The `refresh` client method will now use basic authorization for confidential clients
- The `refresh` client method will now try to make its request both with and without credentials
- The `request` client method will now return the response object if the response status is 201 (can get the `location` header after create)
- Added the `getState` method of the `Client` for state introspections

## v2.3.1
- `client.create` and `client.update` are using `"Content-Type": "application/json"` header by default
- `client.create` and `client.update` alow custom `Content-Type` to be specified
- `node` and `hapi` type definitions are moved to peer dependencies to avoid build conflicts

## v2.3.0
- Added API documentation generated from source - http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/typedoc/
- Added ability to authorize in different window or frame - http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/targets.html

## v2.2.0

- Fixed some build errors (#68)
- HapiJs users have new entry point `const smart = require("fhirclient/lib/entry/hapi")`
- Better code coverage
- Improved performance (#67)
- Added ability to [abort requests](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/client.html#aborting-requests)
