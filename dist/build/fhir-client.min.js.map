It will only work if your launch_uri is the same as your redirect_uri.\n *    While this should be valid, we can’t promise that every EHR will allow you\n *    to register client with such settings.\n * 2.

This is generally fine,\n *    because the returned promise will only be resolved once, after the second\n *    execution, but please also consider the following:\n *    - You should wrap all your app’s code in a function that is only executed\n *      after `init()` resolves!\n *    - Since the page will be loaded twice, you must be careful if your code\n *      has global side effects that can persist between page reloads\n *      (for example writing to localStorage).\n * 3. For standalone launch, only use init in combination with offline_access\n *    scope. Once the access_token expires, if you don’t have a refresh_token\n *    there is no way to re-authorize properly. We detect that and delete the\n *    expired access token, but it still means that the user will have to\n *    refresh the page twice to re-authorize.\n * @param env The adapter\n * @param options The authorize options\n */\nexport async function init(env: fhirclient.Adapter, options: fhirclient.AuthorizeParams): Promise<Client|never>\n{\n    const url   = env.getUrl();\n    const code  = url.searchParams.get(\"code\");\n    const state = url.searchParams.get(\"state\");\n\n    // if `code` and `state` params are present we need to complete the auth flow\n    if (code && state) {\n        return completeAuth(env);\n    }\n\n    // Check for existing client state.
